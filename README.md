Project Title: Flutter Movie App using BLoC and DDD Architecture

Project Description:

The Flutter Movie App is an Android and iOS application that utilizes the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern and Domain Driven Development (DDD) architecture to fetch and display movies using the API from themoviedb.org.

The app will have the following features:

Browse Movies: Users will be able to browse movies using the themoviedb API. Users can search for movies by title, genre, or release year.

Movie Details: Users can view movie details such as the movie poster, release date, synopsis, cast and crew, user ratings, and more.

Favorites: Users can add movies to their favorite list and access them quickly.

Watchlist: Users can add movies to their watchlist, so they can keep track of the movies they want to watch.

The app will be built using the Flutter framework and will utilize the BLoC pattern to manage the app's state. The app's business logic will be handled using the Domain Driven Development (DDD) architecture.

The app will use the API from themoviedb.org to fetch movie data. The API will be accessed using the HTTP client package from the Dart programming language.

The app will have a clean and user-friendly interface, which will be implemented using the Material Design guidelines. The app will be tested using Flutter's testing framework to ensure that the app is reliable and bug-free.

The development of the Flutter Movie App using BLoC and DDD architecture will provide a solid foundation for future app development projects, as it will incorporate best practices in software development, such as code separation, maintainability, and scalability.
